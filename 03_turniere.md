## Event time and Resting Period
The JKU Games will take place from Friday, 17.03. (16:00) until Sunday, 19.03. (06:00).

On Saturday from 04:00 to 10:00, the JKU Games Orga team will have a resting period. During this time, you can stay at the event and play games but won't be able to get new ones from our Games Rental section.

## Tournaments

Compete for glory and fame (and a little goodie) in one of our tournaments. 

To participate, please send Roman a message on <a href="{{ site.discord_url }}">Discord</a> or tell us at the info point during the event. CS:GO and League of Legends require this message sent before the start of the JKU Games (04.11. 16:00). If you already have a team for those two games, please mention so in your message.

The games that will be played have been decided in a community vote.

## Promoted Games

During the JKU Games, we decided to promote a few games at specific timeslots. Mainly focused on the LAN section, this should help make it feel more coherent and communal. Furthermore, it makes finding allies and opponents to play with easier.

Games that will be promoted have been decided in a community vote. Each will be promoted for a four-hour timeslot.

| Start time | Game              |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| Fr 18:00   | CS:GO / Valorant  |
| Sa 14:00   | Among Us          |
| Sa 20:00   | League of Legends |

## Two Rooms and a Boom

This group game will have you protect the president, assassinate him, or sow chaos doing an entirely different task. Of course, not knowing the roles of others, being split up into two rooms without means of communication, and having people sent back and forth between them does not make succeeding any simpler. That's why communication is key.

Two Rooms and a Boom will be played on Friday starting at 20:30 in the Group Games room, where you will get a more in-depth explanation of the rules and roles.

## Werewolf

Werewolves are hiding in the peaceful village and are trying to eat all its residents, but the villagers won't just let them do as they please. Meanwhile, some are scheming entirely different plans in secret to use the chaos to their advantage. The question is, can you trust others and their claims of who and what they are?

Werewolf is played almost constantly in the Group Games room, where you will get a more in-depth explanation of the rules and roles.

## Empty Epsilon

If you ever wanted to be part of the bridge crew of a spaceship, here is your chance. Empty Epsilon will start on Friday at 16:00.

## Game Store

During the JKU Games the linzer Game Store will held Magic the Gathering Events in the Dice Area.
