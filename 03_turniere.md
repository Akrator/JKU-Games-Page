## Event time and Resting Period
The JKU Games will take place from Friday, 17.03. (16:00) until Sunday, 19.03. (06:00).

On Saturday from 04:00 to 10:00, the JKU Games Orga team will have a resting period. During this time, you can stay at the event and play games but won't be able to get new ones from our Games Rental section.

A new Grand Prix will take place every 20 Minutes, starting at 18:00 - the timeslots of the individual players will be announced on Discord, lists are also available at the Info-Point.

At 20:00, we will have the grand finale of all group winners.

### CS:GO (LAN Area) - Friday, 7pm
<em>Battle it out with your friends and foes alike in a high-speed, heart-pumping first-person shooter game.</em>

The tournament is a Best of One on Competitive Settings and will take ca. three hours in total, depending on the player count. The Map is chosen by the standard map ban system.

You can sign up alone and will be assigned to a team, or give your team name on registration.

Bring your computer with the installed game to the tournament. Please install the game before the event to reduce load on our network.

### Blobby Volley Tournament (LAN Area) - Saturday, 1am
<em>Volleyball, but with green, slimy blobs - i.e. the perfect past-midnight game and all-time classic at the Games.</em>

We will play in a bracket system in an epic battle to the death.

If you are confused why you have never heard of this game, it was a bit more popular back in the Windows XP days.
The necessary software will therefore be pre-installed on the tournament computers.

### Floppy Disk Target Throw Tournament (outside) - Saturday, 1pm
<em>To get your brain running after a long night, we will force you outside for this epic Floppy Disk Mating ritual!</em>

If the weather allows it, we will practice frisbee-ing Floppy Disks. The person closest to the target (disk drive) wins!

We will provide you with your Floppy Disks.

### UNO Flip! Tournament (DICE Area) - Saturday, 4pm
<em>UNO, but they accidentally printed both sides of the cards. It's the classical game, but with a little twist (or dare I say "Flip"?)</em>

We will play in a bracket system consisting of several groups playing each other. First to get rid of their cards advances to the next round.

We will provide you with the game (and rules).

### League Of Legends (LAN Area) - Saturday, 6pm
<em>Nobody likes this game, and yet we keep playing it - fight the LoL client and prepare to ruin friendships: Welcome to the Rift!</em>

The tournament will be conducted in a bracket format, each being decided with a Best of One 5v5 on Summoners Rift using the Draft Pick mode.

You can sign up alone and will be assigned to a team, or give your team name on registration.

Bring your computer with the installed game to the tournament. Please install the game before the event to reduce load on our network and make sure that the client is running.

### Super Smash Bros Ultimate (Console Area) - Saturday, 6pm
<em>Smash your buttons and Brawl your way through Super combos in this Ultimate fighting game between Bros.</em>

Depending on the amount of sign-ups, we will play 1v1s / 2v2s .. in a bracket system.

A Nintendo Switch console, controllers, and the game will be provided.

### Purble Place (LAN area) - Sunday, 0.15am
<em>We will decide once and for all on the best cake baker in this weird, purple place.</em>

Another game from the Windows XP times, this one might not be too well known, but that does not stop us from trying to make cake baking into a competition. The rules will be explained at the beginning.

The necessary software will be pre-installed on the tournament computers.

### Staring Contest (DICE area) - Sunday, 2am
<em>Especially enticing for all that have stayed up throughout the whole event, this game will force you to stay awake.</em>

In this bracket style tournament, you will be invited to get lost in your opponents eyes. If you blink, you lose!

Please bring the necessary eyes.

## Promoted Games (not updated yet!)

During the JKU Games, we want to promote a few games at specific timeslots. Mainly focused on the LAN section, this should help make it feel more coherent and communal. Furthermore, it makes finding allies and opponents to play with easier.

Games that are promoted have been decided in a community vote. Each will be promoted for a four-hour timeslot:

| Start time | Game              |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| Fr 19:00   | CS:GO / Valorant  |
| Sa 18:00   | League of Legends |

## Two Rooms and a Boom

This group game will have you protect the president, assassinate him, or sow chaos doing an entirely different task. Of course, not knowing the roles of others, being split up into two rooms without means of communication, and having people sent back and forth between them does not make succeeding any simpler. That's why communication is key.

Two Rooms and a Boom will be played on Friday starting at 19:00 in the Group Games room, where you will get a more in-depth explanation of the rules and roles.
After that, new rounds will start approximately every half hour until 22:30.

## Werewolf

Werewolves are hiding in the peaceful village and are trying to eat all its residents, but the villagers won't just let them do as they please. Meanwhile, some are scheming entirely different plans in secret to use the chaos to their advantage. The question is, can you trust others and their claims of who and what they are?

Werewolf is played almost constantly in the Group Games room, where you will get a more in-depth explanation of the rules and roles.
New rounds are planned to start every full hour (unless the room is needed otherwise) and will be announced via <a href="{{ site.discord_url }}">Discord</a> in the werewolf channel.

## Game Store (not updated yet!)

During the JKU Games the Game Store Linz will hold Magic the Gathering Events in the Dice Area.

We have not yet received a schedule from them. These were last semester's tournaments:

| Start time | Tournament       |
| ---------- | -----------------|
| Fr 18:00   | BIG Legacy		|
| Fr 20:00   | Draft	        |
