## Event time and Resting Period
The JKU Games will take place from Friday, 17.03. (16:00) until Sunday, 19.03. (06:00).

On Saturday from 04:00 to 10:00, the JKU Games Orga team will have a resting period. During this time, you can stay at the event and play games but won't be able to get new ones from our Games Rental section.

## Tournaments (not updated yet!)
Compete for glory and fame (and a little goodie) in one of our tournaments. 

To participate in a tournament, simply get yourself a free ticket using the button below! This helps us plan ahead and guarantees you to get a spot. Left-over spots can also be booked at the info point directly. (The Ticket Shop will open on 6th of March)

<a href="https://pretix.eu/jkugames/SoSe23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="button img">Get a free ticket!</a>

CS:GO and League of Legends require you to get the ticket before the start of the JKU Games (04.11. 16:00). If you already have a team for those two games, please mention so in your message.

These were the games that have been played last time:

| Start time | Game                       |
| ---------- | -------------------------- |
| Fr 18:00   | Mario Kart                 |
| Fr 18:00   | CS:GO                      |
| Sa 01:30   | Blobby Volley              |
| Sa 12:00   | Uno!                       |
| Sa 14:00   | Super Smash Bros. Ultimate |
| Sa 20:00   | League of Legends          |

## Promoted Games (not updated yet!)

During the JKU Games, we decided to promote a few games at specific timeslots. Mainly focused on the LAN section, this should help make it feel more coherent and communal. Furthermore, it makes finding allies and opponents to play with easier.

Games that were promoted had been decided in a community vote. Each will be promoted for a four-hour timeslot. These were last semester's slots:

| Start time | Game              |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| Fr 18:00   | CS:GO / Valorant  |
| Sa 14:00   | Among Us          |
| Sa 20:00   | League of Legends |

## Two Rooms and a Boom

This group game will have you protect the president, assassinate him, or sow chaos doing an entirely different task. Of course, not knowing the roles of others, being split up into two rooms without means of communication, and having people sent back and forth between them does not make succeeding any simpler. That's why communication is key.

Two Rooms and a Boom will be played on Friday starting at 19:00 in the Group Games room, where you will get a more in-depth explanation of the rules and roles.
After that, new rounds will start approximately every half hour until 22:30.

## Werewolf

Werewolves are hiding in the peaceful village and are trying to eat all its residents, but the villagers won't just let them do as they please. Meanwhile, some are scheming entirely different plans in secret to use the chaos to their advantage. The question is, can you trust others and their claims of who and what they are?

Werewolf is played almost constantly in the Group Games room, where you will get a more in-depth explanation of the rules and roles.
New rounds are planned to start every full hour (unless the room is needed otherwise) and will be announced via <a href="{{ site.discord_url }}">Discord</a> in the werewolf channel.

## Game Store (not updated yet!)

During the JKU Games the Game Store Linz will hold Magic the Gathering Events in the Dice Area.

These were the planed events by the Game Store last time:

| Start time | Tournament       |
| ---------- | -----------------|
| Fr 18:00   | BIG Legacy		|
| Fr 20:00   | Draft	        |
| Sa 12:00   | Pioneer RCQ		|
| Sa 13:00   | Commander		|
| Sa 18:00   | BIG Modern		|
