## FAQs

### Why are you closed on Sunday Afternoon?
Throughout the last years, we have continuously extended our opening times and can provide you with almost 40 hours of fun. Unfortunately, since we are a team of volunteers, we are simply not able to find the people required to add an additional day of shifts (e.g. for our service point, game rental etc).<br>
As you can probably imagine, it also takes quite some time to clean up after an event like ours, especially since we have expanded the event area quite a bit. As our locations usually need to be ready for regular university events on Monday, we might run into problems here as well.<br>
And finally, the main organizers tend to be awake throughout most of the event - we desperately need the sleep by Sunday morning, I can tell you as much :P 

### Can we bring alcohol?
We firmly believe that the activities offered can be enjoyed without alcohol as well. Nevertheless, we tolerate alcohol as long as it is not disturbing our guests and the event (see the [AGBs](/./rules) for a more binding definition). Naturally, all alcohol you bring is for personal consumption, please abide to rules on the protection of minors etc.

### Why don't you offer X and Y?
Since our resources are limited, we always have to choose carefully what to offer. If you have an idea that could fit our event, please don't hesitate to [contact us](/./about) - we'll try our best to implement it!<br>
The chances are even higher if you are willing to organize it yourself, so please mention this in your request as well!

Here are some common requests that we will most likely not be able to fulfill:
* Karaoke / SingStar: Too noisy
* Drinking Games: Not really in the spirit of the event
* More free snacks: We understand the desire, but we are working with a limited budget, sorry!
