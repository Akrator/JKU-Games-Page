| Adventure | Baldur's Eleven|
|---|---|
| Language | Deutsch (English possible)|
| Game-Master | Michael [Michl#2377] |
| Rules | DnD 5e |
| Suitable for | Fortgeschritten und aufwärts |
| Description | Baldur's Gate and its port, the Gray Harbor, is one of the largest trading ports in the Sword Coast. The gold and silver running through it has made it a great opportunity to invest in bribery, thievery, and all kinds of fiendish schemes. Usually, such crimes are investigated and handled by the city watch, but recently some new laws are in effect that reduced the Watch's effectiveness. The biggest supporter of these new laws is one of Grand Dukes, Willy Bank. There is no doubt in most minds that his pockets are being lined by some of the beneficiaries of rampant crime and corruption. Proofing such an allegation in front of a court, however, is a different, much more difficult matter. A letter asking you for help has made its way to you. It is only signed with letter R. and they asked you, and probably others, to meet them in the Helm and Cloak Inn, promising a substantial reward for your help with heisting the needed evidence from the dukes own chambers. |

One of the local crime bosses, Clever Tony, has devised another one of those treacherous schemes he's known for. However, he will need to hire an elite team of gobbo specialists to pull it off successfully. That's where you enter the picture. This one-shot may or may not be based on a meme i once saw. Without doubt, it does not take itself all too seriously. However, do not let that deceive you; you will need plenty of wit, charm, sneakiness and stabbiness to succeed.
