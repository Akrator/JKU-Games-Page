## Covid-Guidelines
The JKU GAMES follow the 2G-rule (vaccinated or recovered).<br>
Please provide a valid 2G certificate and your ID at the entry point.<br>
Please monitor your health status before and after the event! Only join us if you feel healthy, follow our contact tracing guidelines.<br>
Refer to our covid prevention concept for more information!

We use the JKU's definition for what proof of vaccination/recovery is valid for how long (see link below), but as a rule of thumb: If the GreenCheck-App accepts it as 2G, so do we.
